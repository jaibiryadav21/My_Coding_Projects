 🕹️ Number Guessing Game (Python)
This is a logic-based game where the computer selects a random number, and the player has to guess it.

 Features:
- Randomization: Uses the `random` library to pick a number between 1 and 100.
- User Feedback: Tells the player if their guess is too high or too low.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of how many attempts it takes to win.

 How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run `python number_guessing_game.py` in your terminal.
